proximity
==============

###Description
Proximity monitors the proximity of your mobile phone or other bluetooth device and executes custom Scripts/Apps when the device goes out of range or comes into range of your computer.

###Purpose
The intent of this project is for the source code to be critiqued by other developers in hopes of improving my Cocoa programming abilities, as well as my programming skills in general.

###Credits
This version is based on proximity 1.5 from reduxcomputing
